This workspace contains examples of building open source software components using three methodologies.  In the spec-files directory, the pkgbuild is use to build the components from a RPM spec file based build.  In the components directory, a make(1) based build is used.

spec-files
	spec based build

components
	GNU make based build(s)

make-rules
	Shared rules to include in component specific makefiles (instructions)

	make-rules/configure.mk
		shared rules for components using GNU auto* tools to build

	make-rules/ips.mk
		shared rules for packaging under IPS

	make-rules/prep.mk
		shared rules for downloading, unpacking, and patching component
		source.

	make-rules/setup.py.mk
		shared rules for components using python setup.py to build

	make-rules/shared-macros.mk
		common macros that apply to building many things.

tools
	shared tools for building components

transforms
	shared pkgmogrify(1) transformations to apply to packages as they are
	being built and published


To build uing the GNU make based build you can
	$ WS_TOP=$(pwd) ; cd components ; gmake -j 4 publish
This will construct a files based repository for publishing, create a log directory, build the components (4 at a time) and publish them to the repo.  Logs of each component build will go in the logs directory
