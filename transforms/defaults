# For kernel/drv, set .conf files to mode 0644.  Assume all other
# files there are drivers, and give them mode 0755 and reboot-needed.
#
# The (?<!r) construct in the reboot-needed transform is a negative
# lookbehind assertion: it says "only match this regex if the
# previously matched text does NOT match regex r."  So it will match
# all files in the various kernel trees, except for .conf files.
