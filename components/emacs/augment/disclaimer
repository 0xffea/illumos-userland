For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other than GPL or
LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to use only the General
Public License version 3 (GPLv3) at this time for any software where a choice of
GPL license versions is made available with the language indicating that GPLv3
or any later version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
is applied is otherwise unspecified.
